            <p>Ify Rafting Company was founded in 1995 by Ify, a passionate and experienced outdoorsman. Having grown up near a river and spending most of his childhood on the water, Ify wanted to share his love of rafting with others.

              The company started small, with just a few guides and a couple of rafts, but quickly gained popularity due to their commitment to safety, quality, and customer satisfaction. Ify and his team worked tirelessly to provide customers with an unforgettable experience, from the moment they booked their trip to the moment they stepped off the raft.
              
              Today, Ify Rafting Company is a well-known and respected name in the outdoor adventure industry, with a loyal following of customers who return year after year for their next adrenaline-pumping excursion.</p>
